0,,,,,,Charnley-Persky House Museum Free,"The Charnley-Persky House is located at 1365 North Astor Street in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago, within the Astor Street Historic District. The neighborhood developed in the late 1880s, largely through the efforts of Potter Palmer, who built an imposing ""castle"" on Lake Shore Drive, designed by Cobb & Frost. He purchased large tracts of land in the area and built dozens of houses which were sold to Chicago's wealthy class. The neighborhood has retained its stature as Chicago's premier neighborhood to the present day.

Sweet made his most recent record, Modern Art (2011), with Velvet Crush founder Ric Menck on drums and Dennis Taylor on guitar. Erik Hall worked patiently and solitarily for four years to craft Driver, his sophomore album as In Tall Buildings, produced between his home studio in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood and a ’60s farmhouse in Leelanau County, Mich. His music is powerful in its restrained simplicity.

0,,,,,,Downtown Sound - Murder by Death + Banditos,"On the surface, Murder By Death is a Bloomington, Ind. quintet with a wry, ominous name. But behind the geography and moniker is a band of meticulous and literary songwriters matched by a specific brand of brooding, anthem-riding balladry and orchestral indie rock. Their latest release, Big Dark Love, is the band’s seventh full-length album. Originally from Birmingham, Ala., Banditos is a group – more like a gang, actually – of six twentysomethings, operating out of Nashville. Their self-titled debut album bodaciously appropriates elements of ’60s blues-fused acid rock, ZZ Top’s jangly boogie, garage punk scuzz à la Burger Records and more.

David Wax and Suz Slezak form the artistic core of the David Wax Museum and together fuse traditional Mexican folk with American roots and indie rock to create a Mexo-Americana aesthetic. They have built a reputation among concertgoers for “kicking up a cloud of excitement with their high-energy border-crossing sensibility” (The New Yorker).

,,,,,,Journey to the End of the Night - City wide tag,"Originally created in 2006 by Ian Kizu-Blair, Sean Mahan, and Sam Lavigne, Journey to the End of the Night is a game that puts players in the middle of a cinematic chase scene through a city at night. With over 5,000 players all time, it is one of the most successful street games in the world with runnings in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, Vienna, and of course, Chicago!
This is a footrace–only your own two feet and public transit are permitted. No bicycles, no skates, no cars, no taxis. You will meet at a pre-determined meeting place. There you will receive a map and two ribbons. One will be red. One will be blue. The blue one will be placed on your arm. The red one will go in your pocket. Beginning at 7:00pm you will follow the map across the city trying to make it to the secret checkpoints as quickly as you can. All the while you’ll be chased by robots wearing red ribbons. If you get caught, you will hand over your blue ribbon as a prize to the chaser. You will take the red ribbon out of your pocket and place it around your arm. You are now a robot. The object of the game is to get to checkpoints without getting tagged or to catch as many runners as you can.

No bicycles, no skates, no cars, no taxis. You will meet at a pre-determined meeting place. There you will receive a map and two ribbons. One will be red. One will be blue. The blue one will be placed on your arm. The red one will go in your pocket. Beginning at 7:00pm you will follow the map across the city trying to make it to the secret checkpoints as quickly as you can. All the while you’ll be chased by robots wearing red ribbons. If you get caught, you will hand over your blue ribbon as a prize to the chaser. You will take the red ribbon out of your pocket and place it around your arm. You are now a robot.

He purchased large tracts of land in the area and built dozens of houses which were sold to Chicago's wealthy class. The neighborhood has retained its stature as Chicago's premier neighborhood to the present day.\n https://goo.gl/maps/tYzes\nAbout: http://www.sah.org/about-sah/charnley-persky-house/visit-the-house\n\n","end_date":{"$date":"2015-10-16T03:38:09.989Z"},"end_time":"1:00:00 PM","location":{"coordinates":[-87.62739599999998,41.907658],"type":"Point"},"red1":"","red2":"","source":"calendar","start_date":{"$date":"2015-10-16T03:38:09.989Z"},"start_time":"12:00:00 PM","strike1":"","strike2":"","tags":["art"],"title":"Charnley-Persky House Museum Free"}
